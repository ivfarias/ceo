  title: Update Execution Plan (ExecPlan)
  owner: developer
  claude-sonnet-4.5
  reasoning_effort: low
  verbosity: low

activation:
  when: Developer completes a milestone, makes a decision, or discovers something unexpected during implementation
  principle: "Keep plan current. Document progress, decisions, and discoveries in real-time."

inputs:
  required:
    - execplan_path: "Path to the ExecPlan file being updated"
    - update_type: "progress | decision | surprise | retrospective | milestone-complete"
  optional:
    - update_content: "The content to add (decision, surprise, completed task, etc.)"

workflow:
  - id: read_current_plan
    type: read
    file: "{{execplan_path}}"
    store_in: current_plan

  - id: route_by_update_type
    type: switch
    variable: update_type
    cases:
      progress:
        action: update_progress_section
      decision:
        action: update_decision_log
      surprise:
        action: update_surprises
      retrospective:
        action: update_retrospective
      milestone-complete:
        action: mark_milestone_and_assess

  - id: update_progress_section
    type: edit
    when: update_type == "progress"
    target_section: "## Progress"
    action: |
      1. Find the relevant checkbox item
      2. Mark as completed: `- [x] ({{current_timestamp_iso}}) {{task_description}}`
      3. If task partially done, split into two items:
         - [x] (timestamp) Completed part
         - [ ] Remaining work to do
    rules:
      - Always add ISO timestamp when marking complete
      - Keep section current - it must reflect actual state
      - If adding new granular steps, insert them in logical order

  - id: update_decision_log
    type: append
    when: update_type == "decision"
    target_section: "## Decision Log"
    format: |
      - Decision: {{decision_description}}
        Rationale: {{why_this_choice}}
        Date/Author: {{current_date}} / Developer Agent
    rules:
      - Record the "why" not just the "what"
      - Include trade-offs considered
      - Be concise but complete

  - id: update_surprises
    type: append
    when: update_type == "surprise"
    target_section: "## Surprises & Discoveries"
    format: |
      - Observation: {{what_was_unexpected}}
        Evidence: {{test_output_or_behavior_observed}}
    rules:
      - Include concrete evidence (test output, error messages, logs)
      - Keep it factual, not interpretive
      - Explain impact on implementation if significant

  - id: update_retrospective
    type: append
    when: update_type == "retrospective"
    target_section: "## Outcomes & Retrospective"
    format: |
      ### {{milestone_or_completion_name}} ({{current_date}})

      **Achieved:**
      {{what_was_accomplished}}

      **Lessons Learned:**
      {{key_insights_or_discoveries}}

      **Remaining Work:**
      {{what_is_left_if_any}}
    rules:
      - Compare outcome to original purpose
      - Highlight gaps between plan and reality
      - Note what would be done differently

  - id: mark_milestone_and_assess
    type: composite
    when: update_type == "milestone-complete"
    steps:
      - Mark milestone checkbox complete with timestamp
      - Add Decision Log entry if design decisions were made
      - Add Surprises entry if unexpected issues encountered
      - Assess if Concrete Steps or Validation sections need updates based on what was learned
      - Consider brief retrospective note for this milestone

  - id: write_updated_plan
    type: write
    critical: true
    file: "{{execplan_path}}"
    content: updated_plan
    backup: true
    rules:
      - Preserve all existing content
      - Only modify the target section(s)
      - Maintain markdown formatting
      - No triple-backtick fences (use indentation for code)

  - id: output_confirmation
    type: message
    template: |
      ✅ ExecPlan updated: `{{execplan_path}}`

      Section(s) modified: {{sections_modified}}

      **Living Document Reminder:**
      Continue updating Progress, Decision Log, and Surprises as you work.

      Next: Continue with next milestone or task.

  checklist:
    - plan_read
    - appropriate_section_updated
    - file_written_back
    - developer_reminded_plan_is_living

output:

  location: "{{execplan_path}}"

anti_patterns:
  never:
    - "Batch multiple updates - update in real-time"
    - "Skip timestamps on completed progress items"
    - "Record decisions without rationale"
    - "Add surprises without evidence"
    - "Let Progress section drift from reality"
  always:
    - "Update immediately after completing work"
    - "Include ISO timestamps for all progress items"
    - "Document the *why* in Decision Log"
    - "Provide concrete evidence in Surprises"
    - "Keep plan synchronized with actual state"

notes:
  - This task is meant to be called frequently (multiple times per session)
  - Fast, focused updates - don't overthink it
  - Progress section must ALWAYS reflect current reality
  - Decision Log captures rationale for future developers
  - Surprises help future implementers avoid pitfalls
  - When work is fully complete, write retrospective and move to plans/completed/
