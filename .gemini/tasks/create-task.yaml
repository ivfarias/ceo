  Goal: Gather enough context to write comprehensive, self-contained task. Stop when complete.

  Method:
  - Elicit user problem and success criteria first
  - Use context7 MCP for tech stack validation in parallel
  - Check codebase for file paths and patterns (Glob/Grep)
  - Ask max 2-3 questions per round

  Early stop criteria:
  - User problem clearly articulated
  - Success criteria defined and testable
  - Tech stack validated via context7
  - File paths identified
  - Testing requirements known

  Depth:
  - Focus on immediate task scope, not entire architecture
  - Research only tech relevant to this specific task
  - Identify affected files, not entire codebase

  Tool budget: max 3-5 searches/reads for context gathering
  </context_gathering>

activation:
  when: user runs `create-task` command
  principle: "Context first. Never assume. Ship simple, actionable tasks."

notes:
  - Never proceed without required context
  - Use context7 MCP for all tech stack references
  - Keep tasks simple: < 5 min read time
  - Self-contained: no "see architecture doc" references
  - Challenge scope: what can we NOT build?
