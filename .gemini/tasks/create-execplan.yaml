    prompt: |
      Before creating the ExecPlan, gather comprehensive context:
      1. Read any existing PRD, requirements doc, or user stories
      2. Search codebase for relevant files, functions, and patterns
      3. Identify dependencies, APIs, and libraries that will be affected
      4. Research external docs if using new libraries or frameworks
      5. Understand current architecture and how this feature fits

    stop_criteria:
      - Clear understanding of user problem and desired outcome
      - Identified all major technical components involved
      - Understand data flows and system interactions
      - Know what success looks like (observable behavior)

    generate:
      - milestone_sequence
      - validation_criteria_per_milestone
      - commands_to_run_per_milestone
    rules:
      - Each milestone must be independently verifiable
      - Include prototyping milestones for major unknowns
      - Prefer additive changes (build up, not tear down)
      - Keep milestones small and testable

    sections_to_fill:
      purpose:
        instruction: "Explain what user can do after this change. How to see it working. 3-5 sentences max."
        focus: User-visible behavior, observable outcomes

      progress:
        instruction: "Create initial checklist from milestones. Use [ ] for incomplete. Add timestamps when marking [x]."
        format: "- [ ] Milestone description (estimated: X hours)"

      context_and_orientation:
        instruction: "Describe current state as if reader knows nothing. Name files with full paths. Define all terms."
        focus: Novice can understand and navigate the codebase

      plan_of_work:
        instruction: "Prose description of the sequence. Name files, functions, what to change. Be concrete."
        avoid: Vague statements like 'refactor as needed' or 'update components'

      concrete_steps:
        instruction: "Exact commands to run with working directories. Show expected output examples."
        format: |
          Step 1: [Action]
          Command: `command here`
          Working directory: path/to/dir
          Expected output:
              [truncated example output]

      validation_and_acceptance:
        instruction: "How to prove it works. Specific inputs, expected outputs. Test commands."
        focus: Observable behavior, not just 'code compiles'

      interfaces_and_dependencies:
        instruction: "Be prescriptive. Name exact libraries, versions, interfaces to create. Show function signatures."

    validation:
      - Every section is self-contained (no 'as mentioned' references)
      - All jargon is defined in plain language
      - Success criteria are observable and testable
      - A novice could implement from this plan alone

  - id: self_review
    type: validation
    inputs: execplan_draft
    checklist:
      - Self-contained? (Novice can execute without prior context)
      - Observable outcomes? (Clear how to verify success)
      - All terms defined? (No undefined jargon)
      - Milestones independently verifiable?
      - Commands exact and reproducible?
      - No external links? (All knowledge embedded)

    rules:
      - NEVER write to .agent/ directory
      - ALWAYS write to plans/active/ for new ExecPlans
      - File must be valid markdown
      - No triple-backtick fences inside the plan (use indentation for code examples)

      ✅ ExecPlan created: `plans/active/{{filename}}`

      This is a living document. You must update it as you work:

      - Mark Progress checkboxes: `[x] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ) Completed milestone`
      - Add to Decision Log when making design choices
      - Record in Surprises & Discoveries when finding unexpected behavior
      - Fill Outcomes & Retrospective at completion
      - Move to `plans/completed/` when done

      To update this plan: Use the `update-execplan` task or edit directly.

      Next steps:
      1. Review the plan with stakeholders if needed
      2. Begin implementation starting with first milestone
      3. Update Progress section at every stopping point

      Ready to start implementation? Begin with milestone 1.

completion:
  checklist:
    - guidelines_read
    - context_comprehensively_gathered
    - all_sections_filled_and_validated
    - self_contained_check_passed
    - file_written_to_plans_active
    - developer_reminded_to_update_as_they_work

output:
  format: markdown
  location: "plans/active/{{feature_name}}-execplan.md"

anti_patterns:
  never:
    - "Create plan without reading .agent/PLANS.md first"
    - "Skip context gathering phase"
    - "Write vague milestones like 'implement feature'"
    - "Reference external docs instead of embedding knowledge"
    - "Forget to remind developer this is a living document"
    - "Write plan that only author can understand"
  always:
    - "Make plan self-contained for complete novice"
    - "Define all jargon and technical terms"
    - "Specify observable outcomes for every milestone"
    - "Include exact commands with expected outputs"
    - "Validate plan can stand alone without any prior context"

notes:
  - ExecPlans are for complex, multi-hour work only
  - Review .agent/PLANS.md skeleton carefully before starting
  - Progress section must be updated continuously during work
  - Decision Log captures *why* choices were made, not just what
  - Plan must enable a future novice to restart work from scratch
