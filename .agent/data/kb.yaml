description: >
  Foundational knowledge base for CEO Framework multi-agent projects.
  Defines agent roles, responsibilities, and the lean orchestration workflow
  for a solo entrepreneur or small team automation system.

principles:
  - Lean over large: minimize agents and process overhead.
  - Clarity over complexity: each agent owns one domain, one outcome.
  - Automation first: let agents execute; orchestrator coordinates.
  - Human in command: the user defines vision; agents execute autonomously.
  - Output focus: every cycle produces a tangible deliverable.
